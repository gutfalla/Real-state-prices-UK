## Introduction

This repository uses data provided by HM Land Registry to explore the distribution of real estate prices in two countries of the United Kingdom. I use the statistical dataset "Price Paid Data" that contains information on the amounts paid for properties in England and Wales. The original data could be accessed at: http://prod.publicdata.landregistry.gov.uk.s3-website-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/pp-2023.csv
